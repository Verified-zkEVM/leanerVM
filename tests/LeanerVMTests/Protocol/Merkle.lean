# Merkle tree tests

A four-leaf tree of two-word leaves against a tree computed with CPython's `hashlib.blake2s`
(leaf `q` holds the words `2q + 1, 2q + 2`): the leaf digests, the root, and the path of leaf 2;
the verifier accepting that path, and rejecting a tampered sibling, a wrong index, an index at
or above the leaf count, a tampered row, an over-wide row, a short path, a long path, a wrong
depth and a wrong root (`fiat_shamir/src/merkle.rs`, the test `malformed_phases_are_rejected`);
a node opened as a leaf, which the depth and width checks alone reject; the zero-prefix leaf
image; and the sibling index as `i ^^^ 1`, the form the pinned source uses
(`merkle.rs:117, 120, 218`).
