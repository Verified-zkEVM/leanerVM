# Tests: the leanISA instance

* **The stack against the pinned Rust.** For two announced size vectors, the stacked size and
  every column's offset, or its absence for a `BLAKE2S` limb, equal what the pinned verifier
  reconstructs (`lean_vm::cpu::layout`, printed by `scripts/dump-leanisa-layout-rust.sh` at
  `a386121f84292f6fa663aaa3e570c15bc0240ea2`). The first has a table as tall as the memory and
  three more: ties go to the lower global index, the shared columns first. The second mixes
  heights and has a `BLAKE2S` table at the floor.
* **Admissible sizes.** The first vector is admissible; the memory below `2^16`, a `BLAKE2S`
  table below eight rows and a stack above `2^28` are rejected, and so is the WHIR rate `5`.
* **The public lines and the bus.** The third line is `MEM_TOP` with cells `0, 0`, not sent;
  six boundary blocks, three per side; the Flock region is `QFLOCK` with `2^τ_BLAKE2S` blocks.
* **The relation is decidable, and the instance meets the bus phase's conditions.**
