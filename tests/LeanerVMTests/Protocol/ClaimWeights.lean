# Claim weight controls

On the toy instance, whose layout is written by hand and knows nothing of aligned blocks: the
weight of a claim on a column, paired with the stack, is the column's evaluation at the claim's
point; with another column's selector it is not; and the closed form of the weight's extension
is the extension of its cube values. A plain file, so `#guard` evaluates the compiled
definitions.
