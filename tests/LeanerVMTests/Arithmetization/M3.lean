# Tests: Clean components as polynomials

A classic test for kernel evaluation. An expression with a degree-two constraint is translated
and evaluated on a satisfying and a failing row; a variable at the width reads `0`, as Clean
reads a missing cell; the syntactic degree bounds but need not equal the degree.

The six opcode tables and the two blocks of leanISA are translated with leanISA's separators,
directions and counted channels (the memory and bytecode pulls), and the result is checked
against the pinned Rust (`crates/lean_vm/src/tables.rs` at
`a386121f84292f6fa663aaa3e570c15bc0240ea2`): the widths are the committed column counts `N` of
`:455`, `:537`, `:608`, `:711`, `:862` (`XOR` and `MUL` share `arith`), the count columns are
`count_columns()` of `:481`, `:546`, `:631`, `:720`, `:871`, and only `JUMP` has constraints,
its two of degree two (`n_constraints`, `:722-724`; the default is none, `:319-321`). Every
constraint and message coordinate has syntactic degree at most two, the bound `d = 2` of the M3
instance; the kernel decides it. Every read count is a column (`CountsAreVariables`, which a
constant count fails) and every message has at most fifteen coordinates, so a tuple determines
its message.
