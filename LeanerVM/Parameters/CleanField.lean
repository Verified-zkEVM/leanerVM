# Clean's field interface for `K`

leanISA roadmap Layer 0 (`docs/roadmap/leanisa-blueprint.md`). `instFiniteFieldK` supplies
Clean's `FiniteField K`, the interface every Clean circuit, table, and channel is generic over,
with `val x = x.toBitVec.toNat`, `fromNat = K.ofBits`, and `size = 2^64`. The roadmap's
dependency table records that Clean's core never consumes `val` or `size`; only its witness-IR
bridge does, and for a 64-bit field its `UInt64` truncation is the identity.

`instFiniteFieldK_toField` records that the interface's field structure is CompPoly's by `rfl`,
so `K` has one field structure. Clean's `FiniteField.toField` is itself an instance, so
`tests/LeanerVMTests/Parameters/CleanField.lean` guards that instance search for `Field K` still
lands on CompPoly's.

Clean's current source uses Lean's module system, as does this bridge. The historical
import restriction (roadmap status finding C8) no longer applies. The field carrier stays
separate in `LeanerVM.Parameters.Field` for the Semantics layer.
