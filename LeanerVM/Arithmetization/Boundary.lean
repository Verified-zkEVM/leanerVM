  LeanerVM.Arithmetization.Boundary

  The three bus blocks owned by no table: the memory seed/finalize block, the bytecode
  seed/finalize block, and the verifier's state boundary, each a Clean component, sound and
  complete for what its interactions say.
  A plain (non-`module`) file: it imports Clean through the channels of Layer 5.

# The boundary blocks

leanISA roadmap Layer 7 (`docs/roadmap/leanisa-blueprint.md`), at leanVM pin
`a386121f84292f6fa663aaa3e570c15bc0240ea2` and Clean pin `93c9d1ef`. Category B: the three
blocks are `crates/lean_vm/src/cpu/layout.rs:352-395` (the "shared blocks" of `layout`), matching
specification §6.1 (`doc/leanvm/body/06-bus-interactions.tex:8`, the state boundary), §6.2
"Flush rules" (`:44-46`, seed and finalize), §6.4 (the bytecode array), §6.5 (`:95`, the index
column), and §8.5 (`08-end-to-end-protocol.tex:70`: "three blocks per side belong to no
table"). The committed columns are `MEM_LO, MEM_HI, MEM_TOP, MFCNT` and `BFCNT`
(`layout.rs:13-17`); the bytecode entry rides eight *public* columns (`bytecode_columns`,
`layout.rs:229-290`, Layer 4's `entry`); the sentinel counter `g^(N_prog - 1)` is derived from
the public program's length and written into the state block as a constant (`layout.rs:335`,
`final_pc`; `:357`, `Const(g_pow(final_pc))`).

**The three blocks.** Every table row of Layer 6 pulls its state and pushes its successor,
and reads its cells and its instruction through the counted lookup of §6.2. What closes the
three channel pairs are the boundary blocks: the *memory block* pushes each word of the image
once, as `(g^i, 1, mem[i])`, and pulls it back with its final count, `(g^i, g^(A[i]), mem[i])`;
the *bytecode block* does the same for each slot of the public program; the *verifier* pushes
the initial state `(1, 1)` and pulls the final state `(g^(N_prog - 1), 1)`. None has a
constraint: each is its two flushes.

**The rows.** `MemRow` is the memory block's row: the address `idx` (the index column of §6.5,
which the verifier computes and which is a column here until Clean PR #446), the finalize count
`cntFin`, and the word's three limbs `m`; `BytecodeRow` is the bytecode block's: the counter
`idx`, the finalize count, and the entry as the opcode and the seven operand slots, in the
order of Layer 5's `BytecodeMsg`. `PublicIO` is what the verifier reads off the public data:
the four lanes of the public input (§2, §8.2), and `PublicIO.ofInput input` is the public input
of a run, which Layer 8 requires of the witness. The verifier is a function of the public
program, `leanIsaVerifier prog`, and pulls `Expression.const prog.finalPc`: leanVM's
`layout(prog, …)` derives the counter from the program and writes it into the block as a
constant, so here it is a constant of the component, never a column and never a public
coordinate, and Layer 8's ensemble is `leanIsaEnsemble prog`.

**The specifications.** A block's `Spec` is what its pull guarantees (Layer 5): `MemSpec r
data` says the row is bound to the image the data names, `MemBindings (imageOf data).2 r`, the
cell at `idx` holding the row's word `E.ofLimbs m[0] m[1] m[2]`; `BytecodeDecodes r` says the
row's entry decodes to an instruction (Layer 4), the program-free guarantee of the bytecode
pull, which reads no data. The program is not the block's to name: its rows are the public
program's entries because the verifier forms them from the program (§8.5, Bus 4;
`Coord::Public`), which Layer 8 states as the conjunct `BytecodeRowsAreTheProgram prog` of
`SatisfiedBy prog`, that the block's rows are `bytecodeRowOf prog i cntFin` for every slot `i`
with some finalize count. `BytecodeBindings prog r` is that conjunct's per-row reading, the
program fetching at `idx` an instruction the row's entry decodes to: proved of every
`bytecodeRowOf` row (`bytecodeRowOf_bindings`), derived for every seed row by Layer 9, and
never the block's `Spec` (Layer 5's program paragraph; decision 14). The verifier's `Spec` is
`True`: the state pull carries no guarantee, since a pulled state need not be reachable
(roadmap acceptance test 21, decision 7), and what the state boundary yields, a run from
`(1, 1)` to `(g^(N_prog - 1), 1)` inside a balanced bus, is Layer 9's
`exists_run_of_balanced`, stated once, from balance, never per component. Access counts are
outside every specification: nothing checks a finalize count (§6.2, "Nothing checks the
finalize counts"), and a wrong one can only unbalance the bus (Layer 8).

**Soundness and completeness.** Soundness assumes the guarantee of the block's pull and
concludes `Spec`, which is that guarantee; the requirement of its push is vacuous (Layer 5). The
honest-prover premise is `Spec` itself, and nothing above this file assumes it: `memRowOf mem i
cntFin` is the seed row of word `i` of an image and `bytecodeRowOf prog i cntFin` the seed row
of slot `i` of a program, `memRowOf_bindings` proves the word's row bound and
`bytecodeRowOf_decodes` the slot's row decodable, with any finalize count, and
`mem_word_complete` and `bytecode_entry_complete` push them through `completeness` over the
prover data: every word of the image and every slot of the program has a satisfying row, in
the row environment `rowEnv data`. Both builders are computable, since they read the image and
the program as functions, never through `MemImage.read`. The verifier is complete for every
program and public input, and `verifier_push_eval` and `verifier_pull_eval` read its two
states as Layer 3's `Regs.initial` and `Regs.final prog`.

## Wrong readings excluded

* The seed count is the literal `1 = g^0` and the finalize count a column: a block whose seed
  carried the finalize count, or whose finalize pulled `1`, would let a read go unbalanced;
  `main` transcribes `Const(one)` on the push and `Col(MFCNT)`/`Col(BFCNT)` on the pull.
* The verifier pulls `fp = 1` as a literal (§6.1, the final frame pointer is `g^0`; acceptance
  test 4), never a public coordinate: a run ending with `fp ≠ 1` cannot balance the state pair.
* The counter it pulls is the program's constant, never a public coordinate or a column: the
  Rust derives `final_pc` and neither reads nor checks one. A verifier reading the counter off
  the public input accepts a witness whose sentinel is not the program's unless a further
  conjunct ties the two, and says nothing per component; `verifier_pull_eval` says the pulled
  state is `Regs.final prog` in every environment. That was this file's first shape, replaced
  on review (status finding F9).
* `idx` is a column of the row here, not the verifier's index column: nothing in `main` ties
  row `i` to `g^i`. That is Layer 8's `IndexColumnsAreRowIndices`, and the two seed tables
  being the image and the program are its `SeedRowsAreTheImage` and `BytecodeRowsAreTheProgram`,
  all three removed by Clean PR #446 (roadmap dependency table).
* The bytecode block's `Spec` names no program: one read off the prover data is the prover's
  (status finding F10), and a parameter would be Clean PR #446's fixed columns done by hand on a
  component that has no constraint to hold them. The statement carries the program
  (`BytecodeRowsAreTheProgram`, Layer 8), and a row whose entry is not the program's at its
  counter is rejected there, never here (decision 14; the tests reject it through
  `BytecodeBindings`).
* The bytecode entry carries all seven operand slots, spare slots as literal zeros, so that the
  seed of a slot and a table's read of it are the same tuple (status finding R24); Layer 4's
  `decode` rejects a nonzero spare slot, and so do `BytecodeDecodes` and `BytecodeBindings`
  (tests).
* The public words are not on the bus: §8.2 checks them against the committed memory by an
  evaluation claim, which Layer 8 states as a conjunct of `SatisfiedBy` over `imageOf w.data`,
  and the verifier reads `lanes` for nothing.
