# The bus channels

leanISA roadmap Layer 5 (`docs/roadmap/leanisa-blueprint.md`), at leanVM pin
`a386121f84292f6fa663aaa3e570c15bc0240ea2` and Clean pin `93c9d1ef`.

**The tuples** (Category B). Every bus tuple is sixteen `K` slots: a domain separator, then the
interaction's coordinates, then zeros (specification §5.1,
`doc/leanvm/body/05-arithmetization.tex:12` and `:16`; `crates/lean_vm/src/tables.rs:90-92`,
`SEP_STATE`, `SEP_MEM`, `SEP_BYTECODE`). The three interactions and their coordinate orders:

* state, separator `g^0`: `(pc, fp)` (§6.1, `06-bus-interactions.tex:8`; `tables.rs:127-141`);
* memory, separator `g^1`: `(addr, count, v₀, v₁, v₂)`, a read of the word `v` at `addr` with
  count `count` (§6.2 "Tuple and columns" and "Flush rules", `:40-47`, and §6.3, `:86`;
  `tables.rs:159-166`);
* bytecode, separator `g^2`: `(pc, count, opcode, op₁, …, op₇)`, the entry of Layer 4 after the
  address and the count (§6.4, `:90-92`; `tables.rs:145-152`).

A typed message is one such coordinate list: the state message is the register pair `Regs` of
Layer 3 itself, over `K` when evaluated and over `Expression K` in a row (one structure, one
meaning), and `MemMsg` and `BytecodeMsg` are the two lookup tuples. The three `toElements`
lemmas pin the order Clean flattens a message in to the specification's; `busTuple` is the
sixteen-slot form, and `channelSep` and `channelDir` name each channel's separator and
direction as data, so that the proof-system roadmap (issue #12) reads the M3 bus off these
channels rather than transcribing the tuples again (issue #13).

**The channels** (Category A: specification §6, Theorem 6.4 and Corollary 6.5). A read is
`pull (addr, count, v)` and `push (addr, g·count, v)` (§6.2 "Flush rules"); the lookup theorem
says that when the bus balances, every count is nonzero, and there are fewer than `2^64 - 1`
reads, every pulled memory tuple is a correct read of the committed image and every pulled
bytecode tuple is an entry of the public program. What a pull may assume locally is the
channel's `Guarantees`: `MemPull` states the whole lookup fact, `MemImage.read` of the image
named by the prover data, since the image is committed and lives nowhere else; `BytecodePull`
states only that the pulled entry decodes, through Layer 4's `decode`, to an instruction, a
static fact about the tuple that names no program (the paragraph on the program below), which
is all a table needs (`DEREF`'s flag pair must be a store mode's) and which Layer 9 derives from
the lookup theorem together with the strong fact, that the entry is the program's at the pulled
counter. The state pull carries no guarantee: a pulled state need not be reachable, since the
fill blocks of §8.3 are closed walks disjoint from the run, and what the state channel yields is
the walk decomposition of Layer 9 (roadmap acceptance test 21, issue #10). Pushes carry no
guarantee; what a push must satisfy is the emitting component's `Spec`.

**Direction as data.** Clean's `Channel.toRaw` reads the direction of an interaction off the sign
of its multiplicity: a pull is `-1` and is granted the guarantee, and a push must satisfy the
channel's `Requirements` when its multiplicity is neither `-1` nor `0`. In `K`, `-1 = 1`, so that
reading makes every requirement vacuous and grants the guarantee at the multiplicity of a push
(roadmap acceptance test 13; the tests exhibit both). Each interaction is therefore a *pair* of
channels, `*.pull` and `*.push`, and the direction of an interaction is the channel it is on:
`memRead` and `bytecodeRead` emit through `Channel.pull` on the pull channel, the one emitter
whose interaction a soundness proof may assume the guarantee of (it sets `assumeGuarantees`
and multiplicity `-1`, which evaluates to `1`), and through `Channel.push` on the push channel
(multiplicity `1`, nothing assumed). Every interaction of Layers 6 and 7 thus has multiplicity
`1`; balance is the multiset equality of the two channels of a pair (Layer 8, `BalancedPair`),
never Clean's field-sum `BalancedInteractions`, which admits at most one interaction over `K`
(acceptance test 14). The roadmap's dependency table states the Clean change that turns both
workarounds into deletions; `Direction` and `channelDir` are deleted in favour of Clean's
direction tag when that change is upstreamed (issue #16).

**The image** is read off Clean's `ProverData`, the string-keyed store a component's `Spec`
sees: `memRows` is its `"mem"` table, one row of three limbs per word. `imageOf` is total, since
a channel guarantee is a total proposition on arbitrary data, and so it normalises: it takes
the *floor* logarithm of the table's row count, capped at the verifier's bound (`maxLogMem`),
as its log-size, which drops the rows at indices from that power of two on whenever the count
is not exactly it. The cap also keeps `κ < 64`, the hypothesis under which `MemImage.read`
reads an address as an index (`gLog?_spec`), so `MemPull.Guarantees` means what it says on
every data. `WellShapedData` is the shape under which the reading drops nothing (the row count
is exactly a power of two within the cap, `wellShapedData_iff`), and `imageOf_apply` is its
specification; it is a conjunct of Layer 8's `Caps`, the verifier's check of the announced
sizes, never a new hypothesis on a theorem. Layer 8's hypothesis `SeedRowsAreTheImage` ties the
table to the committed seed rows until Clean PR #446 supplies proof-committed data (roadmap
dependency table).

**The program is public and the channels are program-free.** leanVM's bytecode is "public,
i.e. not committed, the verifier can evaluate it directly" (§6.4, `06-bus-interactions.tex:93`):
the eight entry columns ride the bytecode seed and finalize blocks as `Coord::Public`
(`cpu/layout.rs:8-11`, `:288-290`, `:383-395`; `leaf.rs:36-39`), and every opcode table's read
is its own constant opcode and its own operand columns, `[Const(BC), Col(pc), Col(count),
Const(opcode), operands…]` (`tables.rs:143-152`): no table knows the program, and what binds a
row's operands to the program is the bus, Theorem 6.4 applied to the bytecode pair. The Lean
follows that division of labour. The program is not prover data: Clean's `ProverData` is a
field of the witness, so a guarantee stated over a program read off it would be about a program
the prover chose (acceptance test 22, status finding F10). Nor is it a parameter of the channels
or of the tables: that would make the AIR itself a function of the program, where leanVM's is
fixed for all programs (status decision 14). It enters in three places only: the bytecode
block's row builder `bytecodeRowOf prog` (Layer 7), the verifier's sentinel counter
`leanIsaVerifier prog` (Layer 7), and the statement `SatisfiedBy prog` of Layer 8, whose
conjunct `BytecodeRowsAreTheProgram prog` says the block's rows are built from the program with
only the finalize counts free, as the verifier forms "the program's whole share of the two
bytecode blocks" itself (§8.5, Bus 4); Clean PR #446's fixed columns are that conjunct as a
primitive.

## Wrong readings excluded

* A push on a pull channel is not a push: `memRead` never emits on `MemPull` with `push`, and a
  `pull` on a push channel is granted `True`. The direction is `channelDir`, read from the channel
  (acceptance test 13).
* `-1 = 1` in `K`: a multiplicity carries no direction, and Clean's `Requirements` hold of every
  interaction a component emits (tests).
* `Channel.emit`, the roadmap sketch's emitter, sets `assumeGuarantees := false`, so a soundness
  proof of a component using it could never assume the guarantee of its own pull; `memRead` and
  `bytecodeRead` use `Channel.pull` instead.
* The element order of a typed message is its field order, a vector field contributing its
  elements in place: `(addr, count, v₀, v₁, v₂)`, never `(v, addr, count)` or the separator
  inside the message (`memMsg_toElements`).
* A table whose row count is not a power of two within its cap is silently truncated by
  `imageOf` (a three-row store yields a one-bit image, tests) and is not `WellShapedData`; the
  empty store is not either, since its image still has one word.
* The bytecode guarantee is not `True`: `DEREF`'s constraints are defined at the flag pair
  `(1, 1)`, which is no store mode's (`tables.rs:616-623`), so its soundness needs the pulled
  entry to decode; that every entry on the bus does is a fact about the public program
  (`decode_entry` on the block's rows), and Layer 9 derives it (tests: the pair `(1, 1)` is
  rejected at every counter, acceptance test 18).
* The bytecode guarantee names no program: neither one read off the prover data, which the
  prover chooses (status finding F10), nor a parameter, which would put the program into every
  table's type (decision 14). `BytecodePull.Guarantees` is the same proposition on every data
  (tests, `Iff.rfl`).
