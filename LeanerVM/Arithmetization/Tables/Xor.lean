  The `XOR` table: one Clean component per row, sound and complete for the relation the row
  refines, its bindings to an image together with Layer 3's `execute` of the instruction it
  names.
  A plain (non-`module`) file: it imports Clean through the channels of Layer 5.

# The `XOR` table

leanISA roadmap Layer 6 (`docs/roadmap/leanisa-blueprint.md`), at leanVM pin
`a386121f84292f6fa663aaa3e570c15bc0240ea2` and Clean pin `93c9d1ef`. Category B: the columns
are `crates/lean_vm/src/tables.rs:436-456` (`mod arith`, in that order), the flushes
`tables.rs:483-495` (`Arith::flushes` with `is_xor`), the result coordinates `tables.rs:461-473`
(`arith_result`, the lane-wise sum), all matching specification §7.1
(`doc/leanvm/body/07-instruction-tables.tex:9-26`). There is no constraint: the bus balance is
the assertion `[o_C] = [o_A] + [o_B]` (§5, "M3").

**The row** `XorRow` is the column list: `pc, fp`; the operands `o_A, o_B, o_C`; the two read
words `v_A, v_B` as three limbs each; the memory counts `r_A, r_B, r_C`; the bytecode count
`r_bc`. The result word is never a column: its limbs ride the third memory read as the sums
`v_{A,i} + v_{B,i}`. A three-limb column `v` is the word `E.ofLimbs v[0] v[1] v[2]`, as Layer
5's `MemPull.Guarantees` spells it.

**The relation.** `XorBindings mem r` binds the row to an image, as named facts: `readA_eq`,
`readB_eq`, the operand cells `fp·o_A`, `fp·o_B` hold the row's words. `XorRefines mem r next`
is the bindings together with `exec_eq : execute mem ⟨pc, fp⟩ (.xor o_A o_B o_C) = some next`,
Layer 3's `execute` of the instruction the row names, `XOR o_A o_B o_C`, from the row's
registers to `next`: the relation an `XOR` row refines, stated over the image itself, so that
execution and witness proofs state their obligations over theirs. The program is not in it:
the table is program-free, as leanVM's `XOR` AIR is (its bytecode flush is the constant opcode
and its own operand columns, `tables.rs:143-152`), and which instruction the program holds at
the row's counter is the bus's to bind (Layer 5's program paragraph; Layer 9).
`xor_refines_iff` expands it into the opcode's equation, the word at `fp·o_C` is the sum of the
two words in `E` (addition in `E`, whose limbs are bitwise `XOR` in `K`, never integer
addition), and the successor `next = (g·pc, fp)`. Access counts are outside the relation: their
allocation is the bus's (Layers 8 and 9), and a wrong count does not falsify the opcode's
specification.

**The adapter.** `XorSpec r next data := XorRefines (imageOf data).2 r next` reads the image
off Clean's prover data (Layer 5) and is the table's `Spec`; constructing and relating
`ProverData` is this one explicit step. The row's pull guarantees have no name of their own:
they are what Clean's `circuit_proof_start` hands soundness as hypotheses and asks of
completeness as goals, and `xor_refines_iff` with Layer 0's `add_limbs` is their semantic
reading (the result read carries the sum's limbs).

**The component** `xorTable` pulls the state `(pc, fp)`, pushes and returns the fall-through
successor `(g·pc, fp)`, reads the bytecode entry `(XOR, o_A, o_B, o_C, 0, 0, 0, 0)` at `pc`,
and reads the three cells `fp·o_A`, `fp·o_B`, `fp·o_C` with the third carrying the sum. `Spec`
is `XorSpec`.

**Soundness** assumes the guarantees of the four pulls (memory reads are the image's words, the
bytecode entry decodes to an instruction, which for the tuple `main` emits is `XOR o_A o_B o_C`
by Layer 4's `decode_entry`) and concludes `XorSpec`: the bindings are exactly what the memory
pulls guarantee, and the execution follows by the arm of `execute`; the requirements of the
three pushes are vacuous, since the push channels guarantee nothing (Layer 5: what a push must
satisfy is this `Spec`).

**Completeness** takes `ProverAssumptions r data _ := ∃ next, XorSpec r next data`: the row is
an honest row, one an honest prover wrote from a valid step of the execution it proves, so it
is bound to the image and the machine executes its instruction from its registers. That is the
honest-prover precondition Clean's completeness is relative to, and nothing above this file
assumes it: `xorRowOf_refines` proves it of the row built from any valid `XOR` execution, so
`xor_exec_complete` states completeness from the execution alone. What completeness then
proves is the encoding: the tuple `main` emits decodes (Layer 4's `decode_entry`), and the
coordinates it emits for the result read are the limbs of the word a valid execution reads
(`add_limbs`, through `xor_refines_iff`); a mistranscribed lane would fail here. For a table
without constraints the constraints are the pull guarantees and nothing else, which is why the
proof is a substitution once `xor_refines_iff` and `add_limbs` have done theirs.

**Rows from executions.** `xorRowOf mem pc fp oA oB oC rA rB rC rbc` is the row of an
execution over the image `mem`: the registers and the operands, the two operand words read back
from the image (`MemImage.limbsAt`, Layer 2), and the counts as parameters. `xorRowOf_refines`
says it refines `XorRefines mem` whenever `XOR oA oB oC` executes from `(pc, fp)`, and
`xor_exec_complete` pushes it through `completeness` over the prover data: every valid `XOR`
execution has a satisfying row, its constraints holding in the row environment `rowEnv data`.
A step of a program that fetches `XOR oA oB oC` is such an execution (Layer 3's
`execute_of_step`). The builder is noncomputable, since `MemImage.read` is; an executable,
data-aware generator is T2's, against these theorems.

This is all a table file states. Facts about its bytecode tuple are Layer 4's (`decode_entry`),
the successor `main` returns is fixed by `xor_refines_iff` under `soundness`, and one-line
corollaries of `soundness` and `completeness` are left to their consumers.

## Wrong readings excluded

* The result is `v_A + v_B` limb by limb, in `E` (`add_limbs`): a row whose result read
  carries any other word fails `XorRefines`, since `step` compares the word read at `fp·o_C`
  with the sum (acceptance test: the mutated row in the tests).
* `XorRefines` names the row's operands and words, not only its registers: an `XOR` row with an
  operand word that is not the image's fails its bindings even where `execute` succeeds (the
  review's counterexample, in the tests). Which instruction the program holds at the row's
  counter is not the table's to check, as it is not leanVM's `XOR` AIR's: a row naming an
  instruction the program does not hold there is rejected by the bytecode pair's balance
  (Layer 9), never locally (decision 14; the tests state that rejection at the block).
* The successor is `(g·pc, fp)`, never `(pc + 1, fp)` (acceptance test 3).
* Every bytecode coordinate is explicit, the four spare slots as literal zeros
  (status finding R24; Layer 4's `decode` rejects a nonzero spare slot).
