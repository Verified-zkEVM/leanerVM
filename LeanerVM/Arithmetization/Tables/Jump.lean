  The `JUMP` table: one Clean component per row, sound and complete for the relation the row
  refines, its bindings to an image together with Layer 3's `execute` of the instruction it
  names.
  A plain (non-`module`) file: it imports Clean through the channels of Layer 5.

# The `JUMP` table

leanISA roadmap Layer 6 (`docs/roadmap/leanisa-blueprint.md`), at leanVM pin
`a386121f84292f6fa663aaa3e570c15bc0240ea2` and Clean pin `93c9d1ef`. Category B: the columns
are `crates/lean_vm/src/tables.rs:688-712` (`mod jump`, in that order), the two identities
`tables.rs:70-74` (`jump_identity`), the flushes `tables.rs:731-751` (`JumpTable::flushes`),
matching specification §7.5 (`doc/leanvm/body/07-instruction-tables.tex:94-112`).

**The row** `JumpRow` is the column list: `pc, fp`; the operands `o_c, o_d, o_f`; the condition
`v_cond`, the destination `v_pc` and the frame `v_fp`, each a single `K` limb; the memory counts
`r_c, r_d, r_f`; the bytecode count `r_bc`. The inverse `w` and the taken indicator `b` are
local witnesses of the component (`tables.rs:706-710`, "local witness columns"): the honest
prover sets `w = v_cond⁻¹` when `v_cond ≠ 0` and `0` otherwise, and `b = [v_cond ≠ 0]`.

**The constraints** are the two residuals `b + v_cond·w = 0` and `v_cond·(b + 1) = 0`. Together
they force `b = [v_cond ≠ 0]` (`flags_sound`): with `v_cond = 0` the first gives `b = 0`; with
`v_cond ≠ 0` the second gives `b = 1`. Booleanity of `b` alone would accept `b = 1` with
`v_cond = 0` and a wrong successor (roadmap acceptance test 8). The honest witnesses satisfy
both (`flags_complete`).

**The relation.** `JumpBindings mem r` binds the row to an image: the three cells hold the `K`
words `v_cond`, `v_pc`, `v_fp` (`cond_eq`, `dest_eq`, `frame_eq`), taken or not. `JumpRefines
mem r next` is the bindings and the execution of the instruction the row names, `JUMP o_c o_d
o_f` (`exec_eq`, Layer 3's `execute`); `jump_refines_iff` expands it: the successor is
`(v_pc, v_fp)` when `v_cond ≠ 0` and `(g·pc, fp)` otherwise, so the bindings alone make a
successor exist. `JumpSpec r next data` adapts the relation to Clean's prover data and is the
table's `Spec`; `ProverAssumptions r data _ := ∃ next, JumpSpec r next data` is the honest
prover's row (see `LeanerVM.Arithmetization.Tables.Xor` for the template), proved of the row
of any valid execution by `jumpRowOf_refines` (`jump_exec_complete`); completeness discharges
the four pulls from its bindings and the two residuals from the honest witnesses
(`flags_complete`). The relation does not mention `w`: with `v_cond = 0` the residuals accept
every `w`, and the honest generator's `0` is one satisfying assignment among all of them. The
table is program-free, as leanVM's is (Layer 5's program paragraph).

**The component** `jumpTable` pulls the state `(pc, fp)`, pushes and returns the derived
successor `(b·v_pc + b·(g·pc) + g·pc, b·v_fp + b·fp + fp)`, in characteristic two the selection
of `(v_pc, v_fp)` when `b = 1` and of `(g·pc, fp)` when `b = 0`; reads the bytecode entry
`(JMP, o_c, o_d, o_f, 0, 0, 0, 0)` at `pc`; and reads the three cells `fp·o_c`, `fp·o_d`,
`fp·o_f` as single-limb words `(v, 0, 0)`. `Spec` is `JumpSpec`: the successor is a function of
the witness `b`, which is why the table returns it rather than naming it in `Spec` from the
row; soundness reads `b` off the residuals (`flags_sound`), and leaves the bytecode pull's
guarantee unused, the tuple `main` emits being `JUMP o_c o_d o_f`'s entry by construction
(Layer 4's `decode_entry`, in completeness).

**The witness discipline.** `jump_env_iff` says exactly which prover environments use the two
local witnesses: slot `offset` is the honest inverse and slot `offset + 1` the honest
indicator of the row's condition. `jumpEnv data r` is that environment for a row over its
data, in which `jump_exec_complete` pushes the row of any valid execution through
`completeness`. Clean's array generator `Circuit.witgen` computes the same two values (the
tests run it), but its environment carries no data, so the data-carrying environment is
`jumpEnv`, whose witness discipline is the theorem.

**Rows from executions.** `jumpRowOf mem pc fp o_c o_d o_f r_c r_d r_f r_bc` reads the three
low limbs back from the image (`MemImage.limbsAt`); `jumpRowOf_refines` proves it refines the
relation, and `jump_exec_complete` its acceptance by `main` in `jumpEnv`, witnesses included,
from the execution alone.

## Wrong readings excluded

* The three memory reads carry literal zeros above the low limb, so the condition, destination
  and frame words are in `K` whether or not the branch is taken, as `step` asserts
  (acceptance test 7).
* `b·(b + 1) = 0` is not the constraint (acceptance test 8): `flags_sound` needs both
  residuals, and `b = 1` at `v_cond = 0` fails the first (`flags_sound`, in the tests).
* The successor is a degree-two coordinate of the state push, not a column: there is no
  `next_pc` column to constrain.
