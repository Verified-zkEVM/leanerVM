# Relational steps and finite traces

These relations expose the existing fixed-image semantics at leanVM
`a386121f84292f6fa663aaa3e570c15bc0240ea2` without introducing a second instruction model.
Failed reads or checks have no successor. `RunTrace` includes the pre-fetch halting rule;
its equivalence to exact `run` provides the finite-trace interface for state extraction
and application proofs. No constraint-system or cryptographic soundness result is assumed.
