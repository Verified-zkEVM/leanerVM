# The adaptor, soundness

`satisfiedBy_witnessOf`: if the announced sizes are admissible and the stack `q` satisfies
`M3Holds` of the leanISA instance on the input, then the witness read off `q` (`witnessOf`)
satisfies `SatisfiedBy` on it. Every conjunct of `SatisfiedBy` comes from one clause of `M3Holds`,
from admissibility, or from how the witness is read:

* the Clean constraints, the three channel pairs' balances and the nonzero read counts from the
  constraints, the bus and the count clauses, through the witness agreeing with its stack
  (`agrees_witnessOf`, with the equivalences of `LeanIsa/Relation.lean`);
* the public input and the two public words from the three public lines, which fix the first two
  cells of the memory columns (`publicLines_cells`), and the image the data names, which is the
  memory columns at the announced size (`imageOf_witnessOf`);
* the caps from admissibility; the index column, the seed rows and the bytecode rows by
  construction;
* **the BLAKE2s validity** (`blake2sRowsValid_witnessOf`) from the Flock clause. leanISA's
  `Blake2sRowsValid` asks every `BLAKE2S` row to satisfy `Blake2sRelation`, the compression on its
  eighteen limbs. The instance never commits the limbs: it reads them off the Flock region at the
  specification's slots, so the limbs of row `x` are the cells block `x` of the region carries
  there (`slotLimbs_flockColumn`). The Flock clause says every block satisfies the R1CS with the
  constant pinned, and `FlockSpec.compress_of_holds` turns that into the compression at the slots.
  No hypothesis beyond `M3Holds` is needed: the compression is proved, not assumed.

Admissibility is a hypothesis because `Caps` does not follow from `M3Holds`: the compiled
verifier checks the announced sizes before the protocol starts.
