# Claims and seams

The oracle protocol is six phases, `commit ⟫ bus ⟫ table ⟫ pub ⟫ flock ⟫ opening`, each a
reduction from a statement to a statement over the one committed stack `q`. The statement
types between phases and the relations on them are fixed here, so a phase is built and proved
knowing only its two seams.

Two kinds of claim, each a statement about an extension read off `q` at a point of `E`:

* a `ColumnClaim`: one column's extension at a point equals a value;
* a `WeightedClaim`: `Σ_x W(x)·q(x)` over the stack equals a value, with `W` a weight of the
  stack's oracle interface (`LeanerVM.Protocol.Field`): its cube values and an evaluator the
  verifier can run (§3, Definition 3.13).

The bus phase hands on more than claims: the point `ζ` it ended at, since the table sumcheck
runs at it (§5.5), and the *forms* it built, one per side and sumcheck table, each a weighted
sum of row polynomials of the table (`Form`); the forms' values at `ζ` must add up, side by
side, to the totals the bus phase computed (`totals`). A row polynomial is one of the instance's
degree, at most `d` by type: the table sumcheck's round polynomials have degree `d + 1`, so its
completeness is owed only on terms within the bound. No polynomial with coefficients in `E` is
built: the row polynomials are over `K` and the weights carry `E`.

* `commit`: the statement is the public input; it holds when `M3Holds` of the oracle itself.
* `bus`: the point, the forms and totals, and the boundary claims; it holds when every
  constraint's extension is zero at the point, the forms sum to the totals, every claim holds,
  and so do the public lines and the Flock predicate.
* `table`: column claims; it holds when every claim, the public lines and the Flock predicate
  hold.
* `pub`: column claims; it holds when every claim and the Flock predicate hold.
* `flock`: column and weighted claims; it holds when every claim holds.
* `done`: nothing, and holds.

The claim pools have the sizes the instance fixes (`busClaims`, `tableClaims`, `pubClaims`,
`poolSize`): one claim per boundary column, then per column of each sumcheck table, then per
public line, then the Flock phase's weighted claim. So the number of claims the opening phase
batches, and with it the opening's error, is a closed form of the instance. A seam says which
claims hold, not which values a phase pools: that is fixed by the phase's knowledge soundness.
Seams carry no challenge; the escape "violated on the cube, zero at `ζ`" is charged to the bus
phase, where `ζ` is drawn (§5.5).
