# The subsingleton bound for uniform samples

VCVio's `SampleableType.prEvent_uniformSample_le_div_iff` says that the probability of an
event under a uniform sample of a finite type is at most `c / |α|` exactly when the event has
at most `c` witnesses. The bound here is the form a soundness argument uses: an event any two
of whose witnesses are equal has probability at most `1/|α|`. It takes its hypothesis as a
statement about witnesses, so that no caller has to name the finite set of all elements of
the type, and its right-hand side is a non-negative real coerced to an extended one, the type
of a round-by-round error.
