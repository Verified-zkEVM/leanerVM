# leanVM's Merkle trees

Category B. The committer's tree is `crates/pcs/src/merkle.rs:119-142` (`merkle_tree`) of the
pinned leanVM (`a386121f84292f6fa663aaa3e570c15bc0240ea2`): `2^k` leaves hashed by `hash_words`,
parents by `hash_pair`, left child first, up to one root. A leaf is a row of `K` words; a row
narrower than the leaf width is hashed as its image `zeros ‖ row`, the zero prefix being what a
commitment with absent lanes leaves out of the proof (`fiat_shamir/src/merkle.rs:54-58`,
`leaf_image`; `pcs/src/merkle.rs:161-192`). The verifier's check is `RawMerklePath::root`
(`fiat_shamir/src/merkle.rs:254-263`), climb the sibling path from the leaf's digest, the running
node on the left at an even index, and compare with the root, under the per-row checks of
`PrunedMerklePaths::open` (`:147, 176-186`): the row has the announced width, the path has one
sibling per level of the tree, and the index is below the leaf count. The pruned form in which
a proof carries the paths of one level's queries (the octopus) is the proof object's, not this
module's.

`merkleVerify_merklePath` is the completeness of the check; `collision_of_merkleVerify` is the
binding half, two accepted openings that disagree exhibit a collision of `hashWords` or
`hashPair`, both instances of the generic facts of `LeanerVM.Protocol.ToArkLib.Merkle`.

/-- The leaf image of a row of at most `leafWords` words: the row right-aligned, after a zero
