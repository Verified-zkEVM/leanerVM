# Power batching

A family of `J` weighted claims is combined with powers `ρ^j`, starting at zero.
The difference polynomial has degree at most `J - 1`. A false singleton remains false
at every challenge, including zero. The empty family is handled separately.

Category A: the power batching of leanVM specification §4.1
(`doc/leanvm/body/04-committing-the-witness.tex:20-24`) and the root bound of §3,
at `a386121f84292f6fa663aaa3e570c15bc0240ea2`. The pinned implementation's first
weight is `1 = ρ^0` (`crates/primitives/src/field/mod.rs:51-61`), as in the
Python verifier (`python-verifier/verifier.py:186-188,1356-1362`). The finite-field
bound below fixes every claim before choosing the challenge; it supplies the algebra
for a later fresh-challenge security theorem.

This staging module supplies the power-batching algebra for the protocol blueprint's
Layer 4 batching consumer.
Derived from the zero-based scalar-batching results in Verified-zkEVM/leanth at
23929f8c922cd4461ab22dbfaa6520f3ad23a3b2, by Aristotle (Harmonic), Stefano Rocca and
Elias Judin: `Leanth/ProofSystem/ZeroCheck.lean:670-697`, `scalarBatch_rejection` and
`scalarBatch_eq_zero`. The current API takes separate actual and claimed values, exposes the
difference polynomial, and includes the empty case. `Leanth/ProofSystem/Stacking.lean:779-804`
uses positive powers in `BatchedAccepts` and `batchPoly`; that distinct convention has an
additional automatic root at zero and a `J` bound.

Upstream consumer: [ArkLib #1](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/ArkLib/issues/1),
for sumcheck and its batching consumer in protocol Layer 4.
The open [ArkLib #615](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/ArkLib/pull/615) at `ca7a2577`
already contains the matching scalar bound in `BatchingStrategy.gammaPowers`. It is absent
from the ArkLib pin `dca90385`; this staging result should reuse that strategy when its module and
probability interfaces are adopted. The CompPoly weight-table pairing remains separate.
