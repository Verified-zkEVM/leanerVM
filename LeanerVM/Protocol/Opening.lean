  LeanerVM.Protocol.Opening

  The opening phase: the verifier draws the batching challenge, combines the pooled claims by
  its powers into one weighted claim on the stack, and asks the stack that one question. Both
  halves, at the slot's schedule and error.

# The opening phase

Specification §8.5, the paragraph "Opening" of the unrolled protocol
(`doc/leanvm/body/08-end-to-end-protocol.tex:94-101` at leanVM
`a386121f84292f6fa663aaa3e570c15bc0240ea2`): every pooled claim is a weighted claim on the stack
`⟨W_j, q⟩ = c_j`, a column claim through the stacking selectors (`ColumnClaim.holds_iff_weighted`)
and the ring-switched claim as it arrives; the verifier sends one batching challenge `λ`; claim
`j` takes the weight `λ^j`, counting from zero, the ring-switched claims first and the column
claims after; the verifier forms `W_λ = Σ_j λ^j·W_j` and `C_λ = Σ_j λ^j·c_j`, asks the stack
`⟨W_λ, q⟩`, and accepts when the answer is `C_λ`. There is no reduction sumcheck: the
inner-product oracle answers the one question, and the compilation replaces the question by an
opening of the commitment.

The phase is batching by powers followed by a query check (`Component.batchQuery`), at the
slot's schedule `draw E`: `Component.batch` draws `ρ` (the specification's `λ`, a keyword in
Lean) and combines the pooled values into the batched claim `⟨W_ρ, C_ρ⟩` (`batched`); the query
check asks the stack the batched claim's weight and accepts when the answer is its value. The
claim values were sent by the earlier phases, so they are in the statement before `ρ` is drawn.
The pool's order (`pool_weighted`, `pool_column`) is the deployed verifiers': the ring-switched
claims take the first powers (`crates/pcs/src/stack_open.rs:518-526`,
`python-verifier/verifier.py:1409-1413`).

Perfect completeness: on the Flock seam every pooled claim holds, so the batched claim holds at
every challenge (`Weight.pair_batch`), and the stack's answer is its value. Knowledge soundness
at the slot's error `(J - 1)/|E|`, `J = I.poolSize`, with the extractor that keeps the trivial
witness, since the stack is the oracle: before the challenge, every pooled claim holds; after
it, the batched claim holds (`BatchedHolds`). The stack's answers to the pooled weights are
fixed before the challenge; outside the Flock seam they differ from the claimed values, and the
batched claim holds only at a root of their difference, a nonzero polynomial of degree less
than `J` in `ρ` (`batchSecurity`).

Written from the specification; the Rust and Python verifiers were read afterwards for the
order of the powers.
