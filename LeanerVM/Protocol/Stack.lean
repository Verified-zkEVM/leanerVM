  block by block, and evaluated at points of `E`.

# The stack of columns

The generic stacking of `ToCompPoly/Stacking.lean`, specialised to the two fields of leanVM: the
blocks are columns over `K`, the stack is the one committed column, and every evaluation is at a
point of `E` (specification §4.1).

* `Blocks.stackColumn` is the witness stack: block `b` at its window, zero past the last block.
* `Blocks.readColumn` reads block `b` off *any* column of the stack's height, honest or not.
  `Blocks.readColumn_eval` is the stacking identity `q̃(z, sel_b) = P̃_b(z)`, for every `q`.
* `Blocks.layout` packages the reader, the lift of a point and that identity as a `Layout`, the
  reading law an `M3Instance` carries. A layout is sizes only, so it names no table.
  `Layout.comap` renames its columns, which is how a layout indexed by blocks becomes one
  indexed by the columns of an instance.
* `Blocks.stridedLayout` reads the strided slots of one block: the low `k` coordinates of the
  block are frozen to the bits of a column's slot, and a point `z` of the column lifts to
  `(slot bits, z, sel_b)`. `Layout.piecewise` joins two layouts on the sum of their column
  types, which is how the aligned columns and the strided slots become one layout.
* `Blocks.stack_eval_ambient_one` is the one-padded stack over `E` at an arbitrary point, with
  the padding term written as the specification writes it in characteristic two,
  `1 + Σ_b eq(sel_b, ζ_hi)` (§5.4, equation (2)).

Category A: written from the specification, except the strided slots, whose shape is the
Rust's (`crates/pcs/src/stack_open.rs:84-97`, `crates/lean_vm/src/cpu/mod.rs:799-805` at
`a386121f84292f6fa663aaa3e570c15bc0240ea2`). Which columns the blocks are, and in which order
equal sizes come, is the instance's to say, not this module's.

## Wrong readings excluded

* The reading law quantifies over every column `q`, not only over honest stacks: a knowledge
  extractor reads the blocks off whatever the prover committed.
* The padding term of the one-padded stack is the weight of the *uncovered* part of the cube,
  not the constant `1`; it vanishes when the blocks fill the stack.
