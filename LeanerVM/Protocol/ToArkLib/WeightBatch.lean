# Batched weights

`Weight.batch W ρ` combines `k` weights on the cube by the powers of `ρ`: its values are
`Σ_j ρ^j·W_j(x)` and its extension, the one the asker evaluates, is `Σ_j ρ^j·W̃_j(r)`, from the
weights' own evaluators. The answer of a table to the combination is the combination of its
answers (`Weight.pair_batch`): the inner product is linear in the weight. So `k` claims
`⟨W_j, t⟩ = c_j` hold together exactly when one answer, at the combined weight, matches the
combined value at every `ρ`, and a random `ρ` separates a false family from a true one except
at the at most `k - 1` roots of their difference (`card_false_batch_le`).
