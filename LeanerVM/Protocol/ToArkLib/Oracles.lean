  LeanerVM.Protocol.ToArkLib.Oracles

  Two oracle-statement families ArkLib's oracle reductions are stated over: none, and exactly
  one. Candidate for ArkLib.

# The empty and the singleton oracle family

An ArkLib oracle reduction carries a family of oracles the verifier may query, indexed by some
type. `NoOracle` is the family with no oracle (index `Fin 0`); `OneOracle M` is the family with
exactly one oracle, of type `M` (index `Fin 1`). A protocol that commits to one object starts
with the first and continues with the second.
