  LeanerVM.Protocol.ToArkLib.Merkle

  Binary Merkle trees over an abstract hash: the root of `2^k` leaves, the authentication path of
  a leaf, and the verifier's recomputation of the root from a leaf and a path, with the two facts
  a compiler to Merkle-committed oracles needs: an honest path is accepted, and two accepted paths
  to one root at one index with different leaves exhibit a collision. Candidate for ArkLib.

# Merkle trees

A tree over `2^k` leaves is built level by level: the leaves are hashed by `hashLeaf`, and each
parent is `hashPair` of its two children, the left child first. The authentication path of a
leaf is the list of its siblings, leaf level first; a verifier recomputes the root by climbing
the path, placing the running node on the left at an even index and on the right at an odd one,
and compares it with the root it holds, after checking that the path has one sibling per level
of the announced depth and that the index is below the leaf count. Without the first check a
row whose bytes are two child digests opens as a leaf one level short, since nothing separates
the leaf hash from the node hash; without the second an index is read modulo the leaf count.

Nothing here depends on the hash: `verify_path` is an identity of definitions, and
`collision_of_rootOfPath_eq` turns two accepted openings that disagree on the leaf into a
collision of `hashLeaf` or of `hashPair`, which is what a collision-resistance assumption on the
hash turns into binding of the commitment.
